4. Any entity of which 50% of its annual revenue comes from work done for

LICENSEE refers to any party ( person or legal entity ) accepting this
license and hence making use of THE CONTENT or utilizing any of the
permissions provided by the license. By definition a LICENSEE cannot be
a RESTRICTED ENTITY.

THE CONTENT refers to the content in full, any portion of it, and anything
derived from it.

LICENSEE agrees not to provide THE CONTENT to THE RESTRICTED PARTY, nor to
allow THE CONTENT to be used in any way by THE RESTRICTED PARTY.

THE RESTRICTION is defined to be this license in full, specifically to
refer to the way the license restricts use of THE CONTENT in any way by
THE RESTRICTED PARTY.

THE RESTRICTION shall apply to all projects with Copyright
ownership by THE RESTRICTED PARTY. This shall remain true even if the
project contributions themselves are done by a person not in THE
RESTRICTED PARTY. Example: No project with a copyright ownership by Amazon
may use this project in any way.

To those wondering why THE RESTRICTION has been applied it is due to the
author's personal experience with these companies and their blatant disregard
for the open source community as well as their illegal methods of interacting
with their employees, clients, and customers.

Some additional reasons for your consideration:
- Amazon: Refused to release a rewrite of Apache Avro as open source when
the sole developer requested it. Additionally Amazon has extensive modifications
to tens of thousands of open source libraries that they refuse to contribute
back to the upstream creators. Amazon is a plague on the earth. Amazon also
holds many software patents which they claim are only used "in defense", but it
is a complete lie. See their various suits over their ridiculous "One Click"
patent.

- Apple: Consistently ignores developers reaching out to them to attempt to
get information / support on their products.

- Avalara: Illegal employment practices. Specfically around reasons for
termination ( past history )

- Disney: Copyright should not be eternal. "The vault"

- Ebay: "Buy it now" patent; https://patents.google.com/patent/US5845265

- Epic Games: Paying off game companies to make themselves into an
intentional illegal monopoly on offering those games.

- Headspin: Refused to release iOS support for STF. Abandoned most support
for STF and left it to languish.

- Micro Focus / SUSE / EQT: Refused to release build process information for
their k8s distribution, only offering the raw source code. This was an
intentional effort to skirt open source requirements and prevent usage of
their k8s offering without paying for support. When directly told that this
was wrong, the leaders at the highest levels of the company responded that
this was intentional and they want to prevent fully open source usage.

- Baltimore Sun / NBC: Refusal to acknowledge and comply with "Right to forget"

- Boston Consulting Group: You know "The Bobs" from Office Space? That's them. 

- Nintendo: Threatened to sue David Helkowski at the age of 15 for creating
the fan site N64.org. Eventually they realized that was nonsense and
purchased the domain for the measly sum of $100. Nintendo is/are really
horrible in the way they handle fair usage of their IP. Other examples are
their takedowns of emulators of their systems. RIP UltraHLE.

- Oracle: Due to their ridiculous attempts to Copyright an API and their
general behavior with Java.

- Palantir: Spying on US citizens.

- Sinclair Broadcast Group: Deliberate license breaking/abuse. Refused to
correct their practices and continues to use software illegally.

- Sony: Due to revoking OtherOS on the PS3 despite it being a labelled
feature on the box we bought the PS3 in. Most never received their $55 for
this, and few wantthat $55. They want OtherOS back. Also due to their
constant updates to device firmware that in no way enhance the devices and
are purely reactions to attempt to prevent fair usage of their devices in an
open source fashion. Sony also released malware to attempt to prevent copying
of their CDs 
( See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_BMG_copy_protection_rootkit_scandal )

- Sprint: Because they are now owned by TMobile.

- TMobile / Insight Global / Logic 20/20: Refusal to give reasonable
accomodation for Autistic engineers. ( and termination for being Autistic )

- T.Rowe Price: Terrible internal security practices.

- Comcast / Verizon: Unethical "overage charges" / violation of Net Neutrality

- Wells Fargo: Unethical late fees

- Kobiton / Perfecto / BrowserStack / Sauce Labs: All reverse engineered
Apple APIs and refuse to share the information gained to the open source
community automating iOS devices.

Considering their disregard for law and common morality it is likely this
license will not prevent their illegal usage of the software, but it is an
attempt to prevent it none the less.

For an understanding of the moral framework these judgements are made from
see https://github.com/nanoscopic/beliefN
( specifically the points that information should be free, non-cooperation
with immoral people, and the legal framework available should be used as
possible to do so )
